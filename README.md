# Haero: A High-Performance Modal Aerosol Model

Haero is a library that can be used to solve the modal aerosol equations in
order to analyze how aerosols form, grow, and interact with water vapor and
other elements in the Earth's atmosphere. Rather than providing a model to be
coupled in a specific way with other models, it provides a low-level application
programming interface (API) that allows you to construct your own coupling and
time-integrated methods.

The short-term goal of Haero is to provide an aerosol model for
[E3SM](https://github.com/E3SM-Project)'s state-of-the-science cloud-resolving
atmospheric model, [SCREAM](https://github.com/E3SM-Project/scream).

In addition to the Haero API, this repo also contains a standalone driver that
can be used to easily set up and run simple column physics simulations in a
"box model" configuration. The source for the driver lives in the `driver/`
directory.

## Supported Platforms

You can build and run the box model on a Mac or Linux laptop or workstation. We
also support a limited number of platforms on which the box model is built and
tested:

* NERSC Cori
* Compy and Constance at PNNL

## Required Software

To build the box model, you need:

* [CMake v3.10+](https://cmake.org/)
* GNU Make
* reliable C and C++ compilers
* a good Fortran compiler, such as GNU `gfortran` or Intel's `ifort` compiler

You can obtain all of these (except perhaps your favorite Fortran compiler)
freely on the Linux and Mac platforms. For example, installing XCode on your
Mac gives you GNU Make and the C/C++ compilers.

## Building the Model

To configure the box model:

1. Create a build directory with the `setup` script:
   ```
   ./setup build
   ```
2. Change to your build directory and edit the `config.sh` file to select
   configuration options. Then run `./config.sh` to configure the model.
3. From the build directory, type `make -j` to build the box model.
4. To run the driver's tests, type `make test`.
5. To install the model to the location indicated by `PREFIX` in your
   `config.sh` script, type `make install`. By default, products are installed
   in `include`, `lib`, `bin`, and `share` Ñ•ubdirectories within your build
   directory.

### Making code changes and rebuilding

This project uses **build trees** that are separate from source trees. This
is standard practice in CMake-based build systems, and it allows you to build
several different configurations without leaving generated and compiled files
all over your source directory. However, you might have to change the way you
work in order to be productive in this kind of environment.

When you make a code change, make sure you build from the build directory that
you created in step 1 above:

```
cd /path/to/haero/build
make -j
```

You can also run tests from this build directory with `make test`.

This is very different from how some people like to work. One method of making
this easier is to use an editor in a dedicated window, and have another window
open with a terminal, sitting in your `build` directory.

The build directory has a structure that mirrors the source directory, and you
can type `make` in any one of its subdirectories to do partial builds. In
practice, though, it's safest to always build from the top of the build tree.

## Generating Reference Documentation

If you have [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) installed, you can
generate reference documentation for Fortran modules from your build directory
with

```
make doc
```

This generates an `html/` directory containing a static website with
documentation generated from code annotations. You can point your browser to
`html/index.html` to peruse this documentation.

# FAQ

## Building and Rebuilding

+ **How do I "reconfigure my build"?** If you want to change a compile-time
  parameter in your model, you must reconfigure and rebuild it. To do this,
  edit your `config.sh` and change the parameter as needed. Then rerun it with
  `./config.sh`. After the script finishes, executing you can type `make -j` to
  rebuild the model.
+ **A pull request has the `reconfig required` label. What does this mean?**
  A pull request with the `reconfig required` label has made a change to the
  structure of the `config.sh` script, so you must rerun `setup <build_dir>`
  to regenerate your `config.sh` script. Once you've regenerated this script,
  you can reconfigure and build as usual.

## Testing

+ **Where are testing results stored when I type `make test`?** All testing
 results are logged to `Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log` within your build
 directory. A list of tests that failed is also written to `LastTestsFailed.log`
 in that same directory.

## Source Control and Repository

+ **Git thinks I have modifications in my submodules? Git submodules are
  annoying! Help!** We agree. These warnings about "dirty" modifications
  are irritating and useless. You can get rid of them by setting the
  following config parameter for Git:

  ```
  git config --global diff.ignoreSubmodules dirty
  ```
